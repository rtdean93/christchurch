# If mod_security is enabled on your server, then the flash Manager will mostlikely
# pop a 'Could not connect with the server' errormessage while uploading your images.
# This is due a bug in Adobe Flash causing a 'Final boundary missing' error triggering
# mod_security to block further trafic at this time.
# The only way to bypass this issue is to rewrite some security rules, but they may
# already be set by your server administrator in a way that dissallows changing it in
# your .htaccessfile. If using it causes your server to error out, comment it out (add #
# to beginning of line) and reload your site in your browser.
#
# Be aware! Changing mod_security rules can create security issues!

# By default mod_security only inspects POST payloads, so mod-security only scans GET
# datas. But when activated on the server it will also be able to scan POST datas (such
# as forms) causing the Flash upload to fail. Disable it for Expose Manager image uploads.

# If previous line didn't solve the upload error, then try to disable the filtering engine
# totally for all files in and above this /manager directory by uncommenting next line:
#SecFilterEngine Off

# By default, the maximum upload filesize is set at 2M by the php engine. If you need to
# upload bigger files then uncomment and edit this line:
