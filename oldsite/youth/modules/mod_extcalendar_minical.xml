  <description>Events calendar with very nice CSS display. Created for MamboServer based on the excellent ExtCal 2 program by Mohamed Moujami (SimoAmi), at http://extcal.sourceforge.net/ based on its Beta 1 release and CVS files as of Feb. 23, 2005. NOTE that this minicalendar has several terrific options--especially for selecting or turning on/off mini-pictures--that you can change here in Administration by going to Modules > Site Modules and selecting ExtCalendar.</description>

	  <param name="mini_cal_def_picture" type="text" default="def_pic.gif" label="Default Picture Filename" description="The filename of the little picture to display. The file you choose MUST be uploaded manually to your server, into the folder components/com_extcalendar/images/minipics. (The default image, \'def_pic.gif\', is already there.) Recommended width of picture is 135 pixels." />
	  <param name="picture" type="list" default="0" label="Picture Display Options" description="Type of display for the mini-picture. \'None\' is self-explanatory; \'Random\' chooses random pictures you\'ve uploaded to the \'minipics\' folder; to use the others you MUST upload image files manually to the folder components/com_extcalendar/images/minipics with NUMBERS as the names -- i.e. 1.gif, 2.gif., etc. Daily will use up to 365, a new one every day; Weekly will use up to 7, and so on. Images should be 135 pixels wide to avoid ugliness, but will be resized by the browser if they\'re not.">

	  <param name="target" type="text" default="" label="Window Target When Clicking a Date" description="Leave blank to load in same window (same as \'_self\'). This is recommended. I can\'t think of any reason why you\'d type something here, but I included it it just in case. You can type \'_blank\' to have events open in a new window, which can get ugly, or maybe you have a set up where you need to target a different named frame or something." />
	  <param name="moduleclass_sfx" type="text" default="" label="Module Class Suffix" description="A suffix to be applied to the css class of the module (normally just \'table.moduletable\'), this allows individual module styling" />
